As a Linux System Admin I'm always need to monitor system logs for any unauthorized activity like brute force attack or co-worker trying to guess the server passwords.

In this kind of situation system generate a special message in /var/log/auth.log file called "authentication failure".

This script send those messages to the script twitter accounts and I'm the only follower of this script twitter accounts and twitter sends all the messages to the my mobile number.
